This coverage includes protection against unauthorized access, data theft, and other cyber-related losses. The policy provides a limited amount of coverage for expenses incurred in responding to and remedying the incident, as well as any resulting losses.",
        "score": 0.4,
        "reason": "The score is 0.40 because most relevant statements are about coverage against cyber-attacks (e.g., 'In the event of a Cyber Incident...', 'This coverage includes protection...'), while some irrelevant reasons mention unrelated topics like Einstein's achievements and vehicle types."

        "score": 0.52,
        "reason": "The score is 0.52 because the retrieval context contains irrelevant statements about insurance contracts, Einstein's achievements, data definitions, and distribution channels, but the relevant statement only mentions riders and add-ons tied to the base policy complying with disclosure requirements as stated in the prospectus, which has a limited relevance to the input."

        "score": 0.42857142857142855,
        "reason": "The score is 0.43 because most irrelevant statements do not directly answer if SBI General Insurance Company Limited is authorized to sell insurance policies by IRDAI, e.g., 'used by SBI General Insurance Company Limited under license.' (as it does not relate to IRDAI authorization) and 'Loss with regard to: a) toe, finger, thumb means actual complete severance from the foot or hand; b) hearing means entire and irrecoverable loss of hearing.' (which seems unrelated to insurance policies), but statements like 'IRDAI Reg No: 144 | Private Car Long Term Package Policy, UIN: IRDAN144RPMT0022V01202425 | SBI General Insurance and SBI are separate legal entities and SBI is working as Corporate Agent of the company for sourcing of insurance products.' and 'Is SBI General Insurance Company Limited authorized to sell insurance policies by IRDAI?'

        "reason": "The score is 0.29 because the retrieval context contains irrelevant information ('Electric Vehicle', 'Material Information', 'Insurance product', 'Grace Period') and lacks relevant statements ('Investigate the role of hybrid electric vehicles in expanding rural India\u2019s access to healthcare services and markets, exploring how this can positively impact economic growth and development in these regions.') that are essential to understanding the query, resulting in a low contextual relevancy score."
