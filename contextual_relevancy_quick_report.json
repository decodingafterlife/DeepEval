        "reason": "The score is 0.33 because most statements about 'Material Information' and riders in insurance policies are irrelevant to the comparison between Electric Vehicle and Hybrid Electric Vehicle, with only one statement directly referencing Electric Vehicles (Statement 5: Battery Electric Vehicle derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine/fuel tank.)"

        "reason": "The score is 0.47 because most retrieval contexts (e.g. 'any other form as may be specified to evidence the existence of an insurance contract', 'Electric Vehicle', 'shall', 'regulations', etc.) are irrelevant, while only specific definitions and clause-related statements (e.g. 'Cover means an insurance contract...') directly support understanding the scope of the insurance contract."
