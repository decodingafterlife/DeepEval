        "reason": "The score is 0.54 because the retrieval context contained information on malware definitions (Malware means any unauthorised or illegal Software or code...) and policy conditions (Whereas the Insured ..., Carry Forward means ..., Competent Authority means ...), which are not relevant to the definition of Constructive Total Loss (CTL)."

        "input": "The term 'Complainant' refers to an individual who has filed a complaint or grievance against an insurer and/or distribution channel, including policyholders, prospects, nominees, assignees, beneficiaries, and other relevant parties.",
        "score": 0.45,
        "reason": "The score is 0.45 because most retrieval contexts contain irrelevant statements about 'Complainant' such as 'Policy', 'Malware', and 'Lost or Stolen', which quote data like 'Material Information' specifically refers to information explicitly sought by an insurer, and 'Carry Forward means the limit that has been made available from the expired Policy of the Insured with the Company.' (Statement 5), which shows a clear deviation from the definition of Complainant."
