--- Improvement Summary ---
Based on the provided evaluation results, several patterns of failure emerge that can be addressed through targeted improvements:

1. **Inconsistent or contradictory information**: The low scores in both faithfulness (0.60) and contextual_relevancy (0.33) metrics indicate issues with providing consistent and relevant information. To address this:
   - Ensure that all retrieved information is accurate, up-to-date, and free from contradictions.
   - Implement a fact-checking mechanism to verify the accuracy of provided responses.

2. **Irrelevant or tangential information**: In both cases (faithfulness and contextual_relevancy), irrelevant information is present in the output. To address this:
   - Refine the model's understanding of the input context, focusing on relevant keywords and phrases.
   - Implement a filtering mechanism to exclude irrelevant information from the response.

3. **Lack of relevance between retrieval contexts**: The low score in contextual_relevancy indicates that the retrieved information does not align with the specified retrieval context. To address this:
   - Improve the model's ability to understand the nuances of the retrieval context, including specific keywords and phrases.
   - Enhance the model's capacity to generate responses that directly address the query while remaining relevant to the context.

4. **Insufficient contextual support**: The low score in contextual_recall suggests that the retrieved information does not provide sufficient support for the query. To address this:
   - Develop a more robust understanding of the retrieval context, including specific nodes and relationships.
   - Enhance the model's ability to generate responses that build upon relevant information provided in the retrieval context.

Actionable suggestions:

1.  **Implement a fact-checking mechanism** to verify the accuracy of retrieved information and identify inconsistencies or contradictions.
2.  **Refine the model's understanding of the input context**, focusing on relevant keywords and phrases, to reduce irrelevant information in the output.
3.  **Enhance the filtering mechanism** to exclude irrelevant information from the response.
4.  **Improve the model's capacity to understand the retrieval context**, including specific keywords and phrases, to provide more relevant responses.
5.  **Develop a more robust understanding of the retrieval context**, including specific nodes and relationships, to enhance contextual support for queries.

By addressing these areas of improvement, the model can better align with the specified metrics and provide more accurate, relevant, and faithful responses.
