        "score": 0.5,

        "score": 0.6666666666666666,
        "reason": "The score is 0.67 because the majority of sentences in the expected output are related to the concept of 'Complainant' (2nd node), which may indicate a strong connection between the retrieval context and the original text, but some sentences lack clear attribution (1st and 3rd nodes) leading to a moderate contextual recall score."
