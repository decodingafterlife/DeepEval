        "score": 0.9166666666666666,
        "reason": "The score is 0.92 because 'no' verdicts are ranked lower than 'yes' verdicts, as the node 'There was a cat' (Retrieval Context Ranking 4) is deemed irrelevant to the definition of Constructive Total Loss under the Policy, while relevant nodes such as 'Private Car Long Term Package Policy' and its policy wording clearly outline the conditions for Constructive Total Loss (Rankings 2 and 1 respectively)."

        "score": 0.8333333333333333,
        "reason": "The score is 0.83 because while 'Complainant' has relevant definitions, the context of its application seems limited to policyholders and prospects (Rank 2 & 4), ranking it lower than more comprehensive definitions (Rank 1 & 3)."
