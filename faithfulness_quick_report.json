        "reason": "The score is 0.60 because the actual output contains contradictions regarding Einstein's nationality (German scientist vs. German chef) and the year he won the Nobel Prize (1968 instead of 1969), while the claim about Zurich being a city in London does not pose a contradiction to the retrieval context."
