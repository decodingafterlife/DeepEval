        "score": 0.9166666666666666,
        "reason": "The Contextual Precision Score of 0.92 is due to the fact that the relevant nodes ('Constructive Total Loss', 'Carry Forward', and 'Sum Insured') are ranked higher than the irrelevant node ('Competent Authority'), but the less relevant term ('Malware') appears at a lower rank, resulting in a score that reflects a high level of contextual precision. However, some explanation is needed to fully justify this score. The first three nodes are highly related to the concept of a Constructive Total Loss and therefore should be ranked higher than other nodes. On the other hand, the term 'Malware' appears in a node with rank 4, which suggests that it may not be as relevant as the top three nodes."
