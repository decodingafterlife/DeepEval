--- Improvement Summary ---
Based on the evaluation results, several patterns of failure emerge that can be addressed through specific actionable suggestions for improvement. Here are some key findings:

1. **Inconsistent or irrelevant information**: In multiple metrics (answer_relevancy, faithfulness, contextual_relevancy), inputs contain irrelevant statements or information that limits the answer's usefulness.
	* Solution: Ensure that all input sentences are relevant to the question or topic at hand. Remove any unnecessary or unrelated information that may confuse or mislead users.

2. **Lack of coherence**: In some cases, the input contains contradictory or inconsistent information (e.g., faithfulness metric).
	* Solution: Verify that all input statements are coherent and consistent within themselves. If a contradiction is present, rephrase or revise the input to ensure accuracy.

3. **Inadequate retrieval context understanding**: The model struggles to accurately retrieve relevant information from the retrieval context in some metrics (contextual_recall, contextual_relevancy).
	* Solution: Improve the model's ability to understand and connect relevant information within the retrieval context. This can be achieved through better natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, such as part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, and dependency parsing.

4. **Insufficient focus on key aspects**: In some cases, the input focuses too much on secondary or unrelated topics, while neglecting the core issue.
	* Solution: Ensure that the input is tailored to address the specific question or topic at hand. Identify the most relevant information and prioritize it in the output.

5. **Misleading or unclear prompts**: The input prompt for the faithfulness metric contains a contradictory statement about Einstein's Nobel Prize year.
	* Solution: Review and refine all input prompts to ensure they are clear, concise, and free from contradictions or ambiguities that may confuse the model.

To address these patterns of failure, consider implementing the following improvements:

1. **Input validation**: Integrate input validation mechanisms to detect and remove irrelevant information before processing.
2. **Improved NLP capabilities**: Invest in enhancing the model's NLP abilities to better understand the retrieval context and connect relevant information.
3. **Revised evaluation metrics**: Consider revising evaluation metrics to focus on more specific and accurate criteria, such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Model fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the model using a mix of labeled and unlabeled data to improve its performance on various tasks and domains.

By addressing these areas, you can enhance the overall performance and accuracy of your AI evaluation model.
